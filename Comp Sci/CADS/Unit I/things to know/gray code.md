gray code is a special coding system which insures that only 1 bit changes between each pair of adjacent cells.

for example in 2 bits would be written as,

In binary numerical order.
00 01 10 11

In gray code or reflected binary order.
00 01 11 10

as you can see in the example each adjacent cell has only 1 bit flipped
