de-morgans law states that,
- The negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations
- The negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negations

formally written as,
$\neg (A \wedge B) = \neg A \lor \neg B$
$\neg (A \vee B) = \neg A \wedge \neg B$

also can be drawn as a venn diagram

Proof,
for the proof just values of A and B and show equality, that should be enough for our use
or also you can show by equating truth tables
