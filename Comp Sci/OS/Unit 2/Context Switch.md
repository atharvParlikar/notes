Context switching is the process of storing the state of process or thread, so that it can be restored and resume execution at later point, and then restoring a different, previously saved, state.

This allows multiple [[Process]] to share same CPU, and an essential feature of multitasking operating system.

### Switching cases
There are 3 main cases where context is switched
1. Multitasking
2. Interrupt handling
3. User and kernel mode switching
